                        <h1>Ren (protagonist)</h1>
                        <p>The protagonist is a second-year high school student who transfers to Shujin Academy in Tokyo, after a false assault charge issued by a high-profile politician, which caused him to end up with a one-year probation sentence. Prior to the incident, it is stated that he lived in a rural area. He lives in a coffee shop called Café Leblanc, located in Yongen-Jaya and owned by Sojiro Sakura, an acquaintance of his parents during his probation.</p>
                        <p>He is canonically named Ren Amamiya starting from its use as his default name in the 2022 re-release of Persona 5 Royal on Steam.</p>
                        <p>As per tradition of the Megami Tensei franchise, he is a silent protagonist, whose personality is based on the player's actions and decisions. However, he appears to have more established traits than any of the previous protagonists. His dialogue options range from somewhat indifferent to outright cheeky. The game allows for quite a number of playful, snarky or audacious answers, including teasing his friends. He also taunts his enemies like the famed Arsène Lupin.</p>

                        <p>Morgana has a commanding and violent way of speaking similarly to a boss, and might treat the rest of the group like underlings, and isn't afraid to be sharp with his criticisms.</p>
                        <p>In spite of his ambitions, Morgana has poor leadership and mentorship skills, as not only does his knowledge fall short at one point past the basics. Not only that, but he's also very clumsy and can mess up quite a lot, even trip over his own warnings. Because of that, he has insecurities about his status, as not only is he sometimes not taken seriously.</p>

                        <p>Ryuji Sakamoto is a playable character from Persona 5. He is a student at Shujin Academy and a former track star who lives a double life as a Phantom Thief. He is considered the protagonist's right-hand man.</p>
                        <p>Ryuji is known as a disruptive "problem student" at school whose bad behavior causes all sorts of trouble for the teachers. He is quite proud of his status as a self-proclaimed "troublemaker" and his rebellious, mischievous and disobedient nature are the perfect qualities to be a Phantom Thief.</p>
                        <p>In reality, his seemingly delinquent-like behavior is merely a coping mechanism for the loss of his reputation to Kamoshida's tyranny and his inability to continue becoming an athlete after the injury he suffered at Kamoshida's hand. Deep down, he is nothing more than a kind and altruistic boy.</p>

                        <p>Makoto Niijima is a playable character in Persona 5. She's the student council president of Shujin Academy who lives a double life as a Phantom Thief.</p>
                        <p>Despite her position as student council president, Makoto is an extremely unpopular student at Shujin Academy. This is due to her not doing anything to stop Suguru Kamoshida's abuse, resulting in all the students labeling her as an arrogant, selfish control freak who knew about the abuse but chose to ignore it because she only cared about getting a good letter of recommendation. While she does give off the impression of this during the Phantom Thieves' first few encounters with her, these rumors are ultimately revealed to be completely untrue. In actuality, the abuse outraged Makoto, but she felt powerless to do anything about it due to the influence Kamoshida held over the school. In fact, Makoto holds no real authority at Shujin, with her position merely making her a glorified tool for the principal to use however he sees fit.</p>

                        <p>Haru is generally very shy and reserved. At school, she is viewed as eccentric due to her tendency to keep to herself and avoid contact with others as much as possible. She has serious trust issues, finding it difficult to differentiate between who truly values her as a friend, and who merely wants to use her for her family's status.</p>
                        <p>Regardless, Haru is mature, level-headed, and kind in almost every way. She is also described to be very feminine, as pointed out by Ann. She enjoys helping the Phantom Thieves, as she becomes delighted when she learns that her hobby of vegetable-growing can prove useful to the group's activities.</p>
