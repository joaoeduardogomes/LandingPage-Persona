                        <p>While being a silent protagonist, he is very stoic, reserved and calm, gathered by the fact that he remains unmoved even when guns are pointed at him, as well as walking under a green sky and being surrounded by blood pools and coffins everywhere at the beginning of Persona 3. He appears very introverted, distant and aloof since he only observes the conversations of his party members and only speaks when someone is directed at him for his opinion on the matter.</p>

She is an orphan whose parents died on the Moonlight Bridge in their car during a fatal incident a decade prior to the game. Her story is effectively non-canonical, taking place in an alternate timeline separate from that of the other Persona games.</p>
                        <p>Unlike the male protagonist or Megami Tensei protagonists in general, she is very bubbly, funny, upbeat and cheerful. Her dialogue choices exhibit a broad spectrum of emotions, ranging from sarcasm, joking tones, utter seriousness and otherwise depending on the player's choice. She is a sharp contrast to the male protagonist who is very reserved and concise where she, on the other hand, is not afraid to interject into conversations where her male counterpart would remain silent.</p>

She is an Anti-Shadow Suppression Weapon (seemingly the last one in existence) and a member of S.E.E.S. who also attends Gekkoukan High School. She is also the main protagonist of The Answer, the epilogue of Persona 3 FES.</p>
                        <p>Aigis' initial personality is simply a robot designed to obey orders, although she is drawn to the protagonist and states that it is very important for her to be by his side, going so far as to hug them in front of everyone. As a result of having no emotions, Aigis' social skills are more-or-less non-existent; it's frequently noted on-screen that while she may look human, she is far from passing as such.</p>

                        <p>Despite his young age, Ken is very intelligent and mature. It is shown that this is a coping mechanism due to the death of his mother at a young age, which more-or-less forced him to give up his childhood.</p>
                        <p>Although Ken is very mature, he still has several qualities that fit with his age and is sometimes too precocious for his own good. He finds a role-model in Akihiko, whom he admires for his boxing and fighting talents, often referring to him as "Sanada-san" as a form of respect to his senpai. He also likes to watch a children's show, Featherman R, but he prefers to keep it a secret.</p>

                        <p>Shinjiro Aragaki is a character from Persona 3. He is a student who rarely attends Gekkoukan High School and a founding member of the Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad.</p>
                        <p>A reliable and serious character whose cold exterior masks his weaker, gentler self, Shinjiro's difficult past weighs him down, causing him to constantly push others away with a tough-guy act.</p>
                        <p>Various parts of Shinjiro's personality are revealed in the different versions of Persona 3, and he is (like most other male characters) difficult to know when playing the male protagonist's route.</p>
