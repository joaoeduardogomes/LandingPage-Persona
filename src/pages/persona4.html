                        <h1>Yu (protagonist)</h1>
                        <p>The protagonist of Persona 4, canonically known as Yu Narukami starting with its use in Persona 4 Arena, is a transfer student at Yasogami High School, and resides for a year at Inaba, a rural town.</p>
                        <p>The protagonist is a high school student who moves to the countryside of Inaba to live with his uncle Ryotaro Dojima and cousin Nanako Dojima for a year as a result of his parents working abroad and attends Yasogami High School. The students in his school are shocked about his transferring.</p>
                        <p>He has a dry sense of humor and sometimes does questionable things which he thinks are funny. He also seems a bit naïve and oblivious to certain situations, which somehow keeps working to his benefit; especially when dealing with the girls, as he is able to get away with things that would warrant a smack for any of the other male characters, mainly due to how little he would mean offense.</p>

                        <p>Yosuke is a clumsy transfer-student who arrived six months before the protagonist. He is often the target for jokes about his lack of muscles and body strength. He fights with blunt, double-handed objects such as wrenches, but more so knives and kunai.</p>
                        <p>His biggest insecurities are boredom and loneliness. He feels the town has nothing compared to the city and that his life in the city is the reason for his unpopularity.</p>

                        <p>Chie has strong sense of justice and a fierce desire to protect others. She is willing to defend strangers from being threatened and attacked by local delinquents. Even when outnumbered, she does not hesitate to intervene and speak out. Chie wants to protect Yukiko and the protagonist most of all, and they serve as strong motivators in her wanting to become stronger, constantly training her kung-fu moves and challenging herself physically. Though nominally fearless, Chie has some specific childish fears: she is terrified of ghost stories, thunder, locusts (and possibly other insects), and being in the dark.</p>

                        <p>Rise Kujikawa is one of the main characters from Persona 4. She is a popular idol who returns to Inaba for a brief hiatus. She is a first-year student at Yasogami High School.</p>
                        <p>Rise is cheerful, outspoken, naughty, cute and is quite boastful about herself, although very sweet deep down. Rise is quickly annoyed by the smallest things, which ends up with her crying dramatically, and sometimes producing crocodile tears. She's rather childish and possessive; she once pouted and told the protagonist he mustn't call another girl "cute."</p>

                        <p>Possibly due to being a Shadow unfamiliar with the human world, or perhaps due to being a cartoon bear, Teddie has a lot of childish naivety, innocence and is pure of heart.</p>
                        <p>He idolizes and respects the protagonist, to the point of calling him "Sensei." In the Japanese version, he has a verbal tic, adding "-kuma" after every sentence, while in the English version his speech is filled with dozens of bear puns, like saying "Bear-sona" while summoning his Persona.</p>
                        <p>Despite his cheery attitude, Teddie sometimes expresses bouts of sadness and confusion. His biggest insecurity is his own identity and potentially having no reason for existence.</p>

                        <p>Having lost both her parents in a car accident when she was very young, Naoto is an orphan who acts very mature in spite of her age. As a descendant of a respected lineage of famous detectives, she wears formal clothing and deepens her voice when she speaks in a sophisticated, stilted manner. She is generally very serious, focused and mission-oriented. She rarely jokes around which can make her seem like a killjoy or party pooper when the team is involved in silly antics.</p>
