## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to create a single accessible platform that showcases the info of the playable characters from the **Persona Q** series. It also served as a practice for web development, allowing me to further refine my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.

## Lessons learned & challenges
One of the challenges encountered during the development of this project was making a functional and accessible carousel. Currently, the carousel only works through the arrows, and clicking on the avatars doesn't have the desired effect. Rest assured, I am committed to addressing this issue and plan to fix the carousel problem in the future to improve the user experience.
